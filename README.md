# Calorie Expenditure Predictor

A web-based application that predicts the number of calories burned during physical activity based on user-specific parameters. Built using **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend, powered by a **machine learning model** trained on real-world exercise data.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to input personal attributes like **sex, age, height, weight, activity duration, heart rate**, and **body temperature**. The model then predicts the total calories expended based on the input values.
